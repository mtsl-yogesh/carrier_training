<h2>JavaScript addEventListener()</h2>

<p>This example uses the addEventListener() method to attach a click event to a button.</p>

<button id="myBtn">Try it</button>

<script>
document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Hello World!");
});
</script>

<!-- 
JavaScript HTML DOM EventListener : 
    The addEventListener() method : 
        The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

        The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.
        
        You can add many event handlers to one element.
        
        You can add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e two "click" events.
        
        You can add event listeners to any DOM object not only HTML elements. i.e the window object.
        
        The addEventListener() method makes it easier to control how the event reacts to bubbling.
        
        When using the addEventListener() method, the JavaScript is separated from the HTML markup, for better readability and allows you to add event listeners even when you do not control the HTML markup.
        
        You can easily remove an event listener by using the removeEventListener() method.

        The addEventListener() method allows you to add many events to the same element, without overwriting existing events.

        The addEventListener() method allows you to add event listeners on any HTML DOM object such as HTML elements, the HTML document, the window object, or other objects that support events, like the xmlHttpRequest object. -->

<!--Event Bubbling or Event Capturing : 
        There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM, bubbling and capturing.
        
        Event propagation is a way of defining the element order when an event occurs. If you have a <p> element inside a <div> element, and the user clicks on the <p> element, which element's "click" event should be handled first?
        
        In bubbling the inner most element's event is handled first and then the outer: the <p> element's click event is handled first, then the <div> element's click event.
        
        In capturing the outer most element's event is handled first and then the inner: the <div> element's click event will be handled first, then the <p> element's click event.
        
        With the addEventListener() method you can specify the propagation type by using the "useCapture" parameter -->
