JavaScript HTML DOM Navigation : 
    DOM Nodes : 
        According to the W3C HTML DOM standard, everything in an HTML document is a node:

            The entire document is a document node
            Every HTML element is an element node
            The text inside HTML elements are text nodes
            Every HTML attribute is an attribute node (deprecated)
            All comments are comment nodes -->
<!-- 
Node Relationships
        The nodes in the node tree have a hierarchical relationship to each other.
        
        The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships.
        
        In a node tree, the top node is called the root (or root node)
        Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent)
        A node can have a number of children
        Siblings (brothers or sisters) are nodes with the same parent -->
<!-- 
From the HTML above you can read:

        <html> is the root node
        <html> has no parents
        <html> is the parent of <head> and <body>
        <head> is the first child of <html>
        <body> is the last child of <html>
and:
        
        <head> has one child: <title>
        <title> has one child (a text node): "DOM Tutorial"
        <body> has two children: <h1> and <p>
        <h1> has one child: "DOM Lesson one"
        <p> has one child: "Hello world!"
        <h1> and <p> are siblings -->
<!-- 
Navigating Between Nodes
    You can use the following node properties to navigate between nodes with JavaScript:
            
        parentNode
        childNodes[nodeNumber]
        firstChild
        lastChild
        nextSibling
        previousSibling
-->
<!-- 
The nodeName Property
    The nodeName property specifies the name of a node.

        nodeName is read-only
        nodeName of an element node is the same as the tag name
        nodeName of an attribute node is the attribute name
        nodeName of a text node is always #text
        nodeName of the document node is always #document -->
<!-- 
The nodeValue Property
    The nodeValue property specifies the value of a node.
        
        nodeValue for element nodes is null
        nodeValue for text nodes is the text itself
        nodeValue for attribute nodes is the attribute value -->
<!-- 
The most important nodeType properties are:

        Node | Type | Example
        ELEMENT_NODE | 1 | <h1 class="heading">W3Schools</h1>
        ATTRIBUTE_NODE | 2	 | class = "heading" (deprecated)
        TEXT_NODE | 3 | W3Schools
        COMMENT_NODE | 8 | <!-- This is a comment -->
    <!-- DOCUMENT_NODE | 9 | The HTML document itself (the parent of <html>) -->
   <!-- DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE | 10	 <!Doctype html> -->
