HTML Documents : 
    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

    The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

    The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration : 
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

HTML Headings : 
    HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

    <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

HTML Links : 
    HTML links are defined with the <a> tag

HTML Images : 
    HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

    The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.

HTML is Not Case Sensitive : 
    HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.

    The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.

The src Attribute : 
    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
    There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

The alt Attribute : 
    The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

The title Attribute :
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
    
    For Quotes we write title as <p title="My name is 'Yogesh'">Click here</p>
    or
    <p title='My name is "Yogesh"'>Click here</p>
