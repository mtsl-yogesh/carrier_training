<!-- 
HTML JavaScript : 
    JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.

The HTML <script> Tag : 
        The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
        The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
        Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
        To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method. 

The HTML <noscript> Tag : 
    The HTML <noscript> tag defines an alternate content to be displayed to users that have disabled scripts in their browser or have a browser that doesn't support scripts.
