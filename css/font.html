Font Selection is Important
Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.

The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.

Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the
correct color and text size for the font.

Generic Font Families :
In CSS there are five generic font families:

1. Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
2. Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
3. Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look.
4. Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
5. Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
