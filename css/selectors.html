CSS Selectors
    A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

    CSS Selectors
        CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

            Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) 
    Three Ways to Insert CSS
        There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

            External CSS
            Internal CSS
            Inline CSS
