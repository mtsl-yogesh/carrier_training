    <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>

    <p>By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:</p>

    <div>You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout. The overflow property
        specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.</div>

<!-- 
CSS Layout - Overflow
    The CSS overflow property controls what happens to content that is too big to fit into an area.

    The overflow property has the following values:

        visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
        hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
        scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
        auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary. -->
