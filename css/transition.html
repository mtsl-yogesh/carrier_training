<!-- 
How to Use CSS Transitions? : 
    To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

        1. the CSS property you want to add an effect to
        2. the duration of the effect.

    Note: If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0. 

Specify the Speed Curve of the Transition
    The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

    The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

        ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
        linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
        ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
        ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
        ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
        cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
