CSS2 Introduced Media Types
    The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

    Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.

    Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

CSS3 Introduced Media Queries
    Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.
    
    Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
    
        1. width and height of the viewport
        2. width and height of the device
        3. orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
        4. resolution
        
    Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).

CSS3 Media Types : 
    Value | Description
    all	Used | for all media type devices
    print | Used for printers
    screen | Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc.
    speech | Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud
