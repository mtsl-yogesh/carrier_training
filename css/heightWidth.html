<!-- 
CSS Height, Width and Max-width
The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

CSS height and width Values
The height and width properties may have the following values:

auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

Setting max-width :
    The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

    The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to
    none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

    The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The
    browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

    Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

    Tip: Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!

    Note: If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width property on the same element, and the
    value of the width property is larger than the max-width property; the max-width property will be used (and the
    width property will be ignored). -->
