What are CSS Animations?
An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

The @keyframes Rule
When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to
the new style at certain times.

To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.
