<!-- 
What is !important?
    The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

    In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!  

Important About !important : 
    The only way to override an !important rule is to include another !important rule on a declaration with the same (or higher) specificity in the source code - and here the problem starts! This makes the CSS code confusing and the debugging will be hard, especially if you have a large style sheet!
