<!-- 
The display Property : 
    The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

    Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

Block-level Elements : 
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Inline Elements
    An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
    
    This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.
    
    Examples of inline elements:
    
    <span>
    <a>
    <img>
Display: none;
    display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.
    
    The <script> element uses display: none; as default -->
